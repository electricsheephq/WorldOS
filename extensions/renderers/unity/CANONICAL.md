# WorldOS Unity renderer — CANONICAL STATE (read this FIRST on resume)

> The single source of truth for the **current-best** room / character / combat-scene + how to rebuild it.
> **An iteration is NOT done until this file is updated.** NEVER grab a "recent" capture PNG as if it's
> current — it may be a deprecated room. This file exists because exactly that regression happened
> 2026-06-28: a **week-old tavern** (`combat_0N`, 06-23) was mistaken for current combat work and almost
> got iterated on, while the real current-best (the 06-28 crypt 3D-hero spike) sat unregistered.

## Camera contract (ONE — do not fork)
Dimetric, orthographic, **elevation 30°** (asin .5 = true 2:1), **yaw 45** corner-iso, isotropic
**cell_size 2.0**, **ortho_size 13**, grid **14×11**. `cellToWorld(c,r) = ((c-6.5)*2.0, 0, (5.0-r)*2.0)`.
(The 06-23 `TavernTier1` used cell 5 / 14×10 — **DEPRECATED contract**; do not reuse it.)

## Current-best per surface (2026-06-28)
| Surface | CURRENT-BEST asset | Build script | Best capture / score | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Room plate | `Assets/painterly/backdrops/crypt_pinned_v1.png` (camera-pinned painterly crypt; L6 ~6–7) | `paint_3d_spike.cs` | `Captures-Durable/painted_backdrop_r3.png` | ✅ canonical |
| Character (hero) | `Assets/painterly/models/hero.fbx` + `hero_albedo.png` (2048²) on a Standard/PainterlyActor mat | `paint_3d_spike.cs` | `Captures-Durable/m10_spike.png` — **Gate-1 PASSED** (textured, lit, grounded 3D actor) | ✅ canonical 3D actor |
| Animator | `HeroAnim_CL.controller` + 9-clip moveset from `meshy_gen.py --moveset` | `ClosedLoopBuilder.cs` + `unity-editor-patterns-m1-combat.md` | — | ⚠ WIP |
| Combat SCENE (multi-actor) | **NOT YET BUILT on the canonical foundation** | (target) `ClosedLoopBuilder.cs` on crypt + 3D hero + goblin | — | ▶ **NEXT TARGET** |

## DEPRECATED (do NOT resume from these)
- `TavernTier1.unity` + `Captures/combat_0[1-4]_*.png` (06-23) — week-old tavern; floating dark actors,
  no rings/VFX/goblin. Visual-critic 2026-06-28: **L5=3.5 CRITICAL, L2=4.5/L1=5.5 HIGH (~overall 4-5)**.
  Superseded by the crypt 3D-actor pipeline.
- 8-facing **billboard** hero sprites (`Assets/painterly/sprites/hero/hero_*.png`) — the billboard approach
  (capped ~4/10 "pasted sticker"); superseded by the real 3D actor (the PoE2 pivot).

## Rebuild the current-best (deterministic)
```bash
# on the GEX44 box (gex44-unity-host skill); scripts live in this dir, deploy then:
~/.local/bin/unity-mcp code execute --no-safety-checks -f paint_3d_spike.cs
#   -> /home/unity/worldos-unity/Captures-Durable/m10_spike.png  (crypt + textured/lit/grounded 3D hero)
```

## ITERATION DISCIPLINE — an iteration is NOT done until ALL of these
1. **Persist:** the build script ends with `EditorSceneManager.SaveScene(...)` (not render-and-forget) AND
   is committed here in `extensions/renderers/unity/scripts/`.
2. **Capture + score:** durable PNG in `Captures-Durable/` + logged to `qa/scores_db.py` (surface=visual, milestone).
3. **Register:** update THIS file — add the new current-best row, mark the superseded one DEPRECATED.
4. **Save off-box:** commit to the WorldOS repo (version control) + periodic box tarball
   (`worldos-unity-SAVE-<date>.tgz`, excl. Library/Temp).
5. **On RESUME:** read THIS file FIRST. Never infer "current" from a recent capture PNG.

## Build-script inventory (`extensions/renderers/unity/scripts/`)
- **canonical:** `paint_3d_spike.cs` (crypt 3D-hero spike), `paint_backdrop_p0.cs` (camera-pinned plate),
  `ClosedLoopBuilder.cs` (combat scene builder), `CombatSurfaceDemo.cs` (engine-cell positioning + rings/shadow),
  `CombatBeatDriver.cs` (beat sequencer), `RTCapture.cs` (render capture), `SetupPainterlyScene.cs`.
- **deprecated/proof (billboard-era or one-off):** `IsoSpriteRenderer.cs`, `IsoHeroRender.cs`, `AnimProof.cs`,
  `DungeonPathingProof.cs`, `PathingTestDriver.cs`, `TavernTier1Builder.cs`, `CharsV3Import.cs`, `AddWalkState.cs`.
